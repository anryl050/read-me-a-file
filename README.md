## Project Description
Create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. 

### User Story
As a developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project

### Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input:

- WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository, THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions. 

- WHEN I enter my project title, THEN this is displayed as the title of the README.

- WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.

- WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options, THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.

- WHEN I enter my GitHub username, THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile.

- WHEN I enter my email address, THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions.

- WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents, THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README.
